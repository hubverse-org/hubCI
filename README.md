Continuous Integration workflows.

## Installation

### Latest

You can install the [latest version of hubCI from the
R-universe](https://hubverse-org.r-universe.dev/hubCI):

``` r
install.packages("hubCI", repos = c("https://hubverse-org.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

### Development

If you want to test out new features that have not yet been released,
you can install the development version of hubCI from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")

## Example

For hubs hosted on GitHub, use `use_hub_github_action()` to download one
of the [hubverse GitHub

*Note: the hub most be configured as an R project (i.e.Â contain a
`*.Rproj` file)*

``` r
