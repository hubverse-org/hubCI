The goal of hubCI is to provide functionality for setting up hubverse
Continuous Integration workflows.

## Installation

You can install the development version of hubCI like so:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("hubverse-org/hubValidations")
```

## Example

### Setting up a GitHub Action

For hubs hosted on GitHub, use `use_hub_github_action()` to download one
of the [hubverse GitHub
Actions](https://github.com/hubverse-org/hubverse-actions).

*Note: the hub most be configured as an R project (i.e.Â contain a
`*.Rproj` file)*

``` r
library(hubCI)

use_hub_github_action(name = "validate-submission")
```
