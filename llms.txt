# hubCI

The goal of hubCI is to provide functionality for setting up hubverse
Continuous Integration workflows.

## Installation

### Latest

You can install the [latest version of hubCI from the
R-universe](https://hubverse-org.r-universe.dev/hubCI):

``` r
install.packages("hubCI", repos = c("https://hubverse-org.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

### Development

If you want to test out new features that have not yet been released,
you can install the development version of hubCI from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("hubverse-org/hubCI")
```

## Example

### Setting up a GitHub Action

For hubs hosted on GitHub, use
[`use_hub_github_action()`](https://hubverse-org.github.io/hubCI/reference/use_hub_github_action.md)
to download one of the [hubverse GitHub
Actions](https://github.com/hubverse-org/hubverse-actions).

*Note: the hub most be configured as an R project (i.e. contain a
`*.Rproj` file)*

``` r
library(hubCI)

use_hub_github_action(name = "validate-submission")
```
